# Profitable-App-Profiles

The goal of this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. I will be improving my skills as a data engineer by working as an engineer for a company that builds both Android and IOS mobile apps so that I can enable developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of applications they build.

At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
