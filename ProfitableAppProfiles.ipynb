    "# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. I will be improving my skills as a data engineer by working as an engineer for a company that builds both Android and IOS mobile apps so that I can enable developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of applications they build.\n",
    "\n",
    "At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening and Exploring the Data\n",
    "As of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play. \n",
    "![Avaialble IOS and Android Apps in 2018](/Data/assets/images/py1m8_statista.png)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Collecting data for over 4 million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so we'll try to analyze a sample of the data instead. To avoid spending resources on collecting new data ourselves, we should first try to see if we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, here are two datasets that seem suitable for our goals:\n",
    "- A `googleplaystore.csv` dataset containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018.\n",
    "- A `AppleStore.csv` dataset containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017."

One thing we could do is take another popular book and turn it into an app where we could add different features besides the raw version of the book.
